    <h1>THE EARTH</h1>
    <p>
      Earth, third planet from the Sun and the fifth largest in the solar system in terms of size and mass. Its single most outstanding feature is that its near-surface environments are the only places in the universe known to harbour life.
      It is designated by the symbol ⊕. Earth’s name in English, the international language of astronomy, derives from Old English and Germanic words for ground and earth.
      It is the only name for a planet in the solar system that does not come from Greco-Roman mythology.
